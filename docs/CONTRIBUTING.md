## Commit Messages
We use **gitmojis** for our commit messages to easily identify the purpose of each commit. Please keep the following in mind:

- Use an appropriate gitmoji for each commit. For example:
  - ✨: Feature implementation
  - 🐛: Bug fix
  - 📝: Documentation changes
  - 🔧: Configuration changes
  - 🎨: Code structure improvements

- **Commit messages should not exceed 100 characters.**

- Follow the format:
  ```
  :gitmoji: Commit message (max 100 characters)
  ```

- Example:
  ```
  ✨ Add user authentication to the API (max 100 characters)
  ```
